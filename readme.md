# Halloween 2023!!!

All of this work is based off the series of videos by [Dave Plummer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hYmpztMQe0&list=PLF2KJ6Gy3cZ7ynsp8s4tnqEFmY15CKhmH)

I'm hoping to develop a set of helpers and easy configurations to allow multiple effects off a single string of LEDs.

Halloween2023 has been the biggest motivator but Christmas is coming up.
